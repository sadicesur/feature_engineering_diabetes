Welcome to this Jupyter notebook project, where we embark on a journey of feature engineering to develop a machine learning model for predicting diabetes in individuals. This project emphasizes the importance of data analysis and feature engineering in building reliable predictive models. Our aim is to create a robust and interpretable model by focusing on foundational aspects such as data analysis and feature engineering, which will lead to accurate predictions.

### Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project is a subset of a larger dataset maintained by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in the United States. It specifically focuses on a diabetes research study conducted on Pima Indian women aged 21 and above, residing in Phoenix, Arizona. The dataset contains valuable information used to investigate diabetes prevalence among the study participants.

The target variable, labeled as "Outcome," is the focus of our analysis. It is binary, with a value of 1 indicating a positive diabetes test result and 0 indicating a negative result. The dataset comprises diverse features, including the number of pregnancies, 2-hour plasma glucose concentration, diastolic blood pressure, triceps skinfold thickness, 2-hour serum insulin level, diabetes pedigree function, body mass index (BMI), and age. These features are expected to contribute to the prediction of diabetes presence in the participants. By leveraging feature engineering and machine learning, we aim to build a reliable model that predicts the likelihood of individuals having diabetes based on the provided features.

### Data Preprocessing and Analysis

In the Jupyter notebook, we start by importing the necessary libraries for data analysis and visualization. We then load the dataset and conduct various data exploration and analysis steps, including:

- Displaying descriptive statistics of the dataset.
- Examining unique values, null counts, and data types for each feature.
- Separating categorical, numerical, and cardinal features.
- Visualizing histograms and boxplots for numerical features to understand the data distribution and identify potential outliers.
- Visualizing the relationship between numerical features and the target variable to gain insights into feature importance.
- Detecting and handling outliers using Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm.
- Handling missing values using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation.

### Model Building

After data preprocessing and analysis, we split the dataset into training and testing sets. We use the RandomForestClassifier to build a machine learning model for diabetes prediction. The model is evaluated based on its accuracy score and confusion matrix.

Please refer to the Jupyter notebook for detailed code implementation and further analysis.
